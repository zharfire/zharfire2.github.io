								<h3>Wildfire: How They Form and Why They're So Dangerous (National Geographic 2023)</h3>
								<p>The recent outbreak of devastating wildfires in Northern California's wine country underscores the imperative of comprehending both the origins and enduring ramifications of such phenomena. Predominantly ignited by human activities, these wildfires are exacerbated by arid climatic conditions and intensified by strong winds. While historically beneficial to ecosystems by virtue of their role in underbrush clearance, wildfires have seen a shift in their ecological function due to suppression efforts, resulting in heightened severity. Contemporary approaches such as managed wildfires and prescribed burns seek to ameliorate ecological imbalances. Nonetheless, wildfires wield profound and protracted consequences, exerting a warming influence on the global climate, compromising human health, and reshaping wildlife habitats. Despite adaptive capacities among certain species, vulnerable fauna face heightened risks. Thus, a thorough comprehension and adept management of wildfires emerge as imperatives for mitigating their extensive and enduring impacts.</p>

								<h3>Bushfire: What, Why, Where and When it occurs (Australia Disaster Resilience Knowledgehub)</h3>
								<p>At any time of the year, some parts of Australia are prone to bushfires. For northern Australia the peak bushfire period is during the dry season, which is generally throughout winter and spring. In southern Australia, the bushfire season peaks in summer and autumn. While these are traditional peaks of the bushfire season, local conditions can drive dangerous bushfire activity at any time.</p>

								<h3>The Age of Megafires: The World Hits a Climate Tipping Point (Yale Environment 360, 2020)</h3>
								<p>From Siberia to Australia to the western U.S., massive fires have consumed millions of acres this year and spawned fire-generated tornados and other phenomena rarely seen before. Scientists say the world has entered a perilous new era that will demand better ways of fighting wildfires.</p>

								<h3>WildFireSat: Enhancing Canada's ability to manage wildfires (Canadian Space Agency)</h3>
								<p>Climate change is causing extreme weather conditions, more intense fires, and longer wildfire seasons. This is a challenge for those who live with and those who manage wildfires. WildFireSat is a satellite mission that will monitor all active wildfires in Canada on a daily basis. It will provide reliable data to allow for better prediction of fire behaviour to help wildfire managers prepare and respond, and allow for more targeted and faster evacuations.</p>
